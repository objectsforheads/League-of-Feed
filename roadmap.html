    <h2>One day, we'll reach Gold V. One day, we'll finish League of Feed.</h2>
    <p>League of Feed was created for the Riot 2016 API challenge. Its name was a play on the idea that it would be a 'feed' of your and your friends' accomplishments. Then, when it became apparent that one weekend was not enough to get anything we wanted done (ie. the feed), the name stayed as a reminder of our Silver I-level ambitions. One day, Gold V, one day.</p>
    <p>A user-friendly roadmap is on its way.

    A vague roadmap is available at our <a href="https://github.com/objectsforheads/League-of-Feed#roadmap">github repo</a></p>
